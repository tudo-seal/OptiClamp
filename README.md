Additively manufactured parts often require a finishing step to achieve either desired surface quality or precision of
critical features.
To perform this finishing step, the additive parts need to be fixed. Often, due to their complex geometry, this is not
possible with a conventional clamp.

OptiClamp facilitates generating custom jaw geometry that allows such parts to be conventionally clamped.

This can be useful for parts that are additively manufactured in medium lot-sizes, repeatedly saving time on setting up
the finishing step.
